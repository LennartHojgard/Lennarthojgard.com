            <p class="article-content">Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm Lennart, and I like long walks on the beach, piÃ±a coladas, and sharing my life story with strangers on the web.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here you'll find my short CV, couple of blogposts, and a list of every book I've ever read (okay, maybe not every book, but I'm working on it). So, whether you stumbled upon my website by accident or have been stalking me on the internet (no judgment here), I'm glad you're here!
                <br>
                <br>
                Take a look around, get to know me a little better, and if you like what you see, drop me a line. Who knows, maybe we'll be fast friends. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, for now, just sit back, relax, and cramp your toes of all the cringe going on around here!</p>
